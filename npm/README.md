## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart)

The JWT Decoder API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/jwtdecoder](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/jwtdecoder).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```javascript
const jwtdecoderAPI = require('@apiverve/jwtdecoder');
const api = new jwtdecoderAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "header": {
      "alg": "HS256",

      "iat": 1516239022
    },
    "signature": "SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c",
    "isExpired": false,
    "expiresAt": null,
    "warning": "This API only decodes JWT tokens. It does NOT verify signatures. Do not use for security validation."
